                <h2>About Us</h2>
                <p>Atlanta House Buyers buys houses from people in situations just like yours and solve their real estate problems.</p>
                <p>We know that trying to sell your own home can be a major hassle! There are Real Estate Contracts that can tie you to commissions, even if you sell the house without the help of an Agent. Listing a house in the newspaper and other publications can be terribly expensive, even if for only a few days. And, after it is all over and the advertisers and Agents take all your money, you may walk away with nothing in your pocket.</p>
                <p>I am not a Realtor, just a private individual, like you. If you have never tried to sell a home, you may not understand all that's involved: the commissions, the loan approval time, the waiting for agent to show your house, the ads that never seem to make the phone ring-- the list goes on. Having strangers walking through every room trying to find the smallest thing to bring down your commission inflated asking price.... in fact, it can easily turn into a horrible  experience.</p>
                <p>I do know what homeowners go through when they try to sell their home. You may still be in the "thinking about it" stage. Maybe you've already tried listing your house with an agent... maybe you haven't decided you're ready to go that route yet.</p>

                        <p>“About a 18 months ago I was looking for a home, but I was not able to buy home right away since I had just divorced and we had lost our home due to foreclosure. With very few options left, I decided to lease option a home from Nancy.</p>
                        <p>Nancy took care of all the paper work and arranged a mortgage broker for me. I was able to purchase my lease-option home in 18 months. I am very happy with the service from Nancy and would recommend her to any person considering a lease-option program.”</p>

                        </h3>
                        <p>“We listed our house like everybody with real-estate service, for two years we did not get any offer, we changed brokers and following their suggestions we made many improvements to my house. We were still not successful in selling the house. All that time we were making the mortgage payments and paying utility bills.</p>
                        <p>Finally, we called Alvito and Nancy Silveira, we found out their service through their website atlantahousebuyers.com. They were very prompt in responding to us and made us an offer within 24 hours. We sold the house to them with owner financing. They did all necessary paper work and arranged the closing.</p>

She came to my house and after discussing my needs with her we were able to work an arrangement that met my needs … She has been very helpful and straightforward with me during the whole process. I liked working with her and would recommend her to other individuals in my situation.”</p>

I contacted Nancy through her website and she came and made me an offer on the spot and handled all the contacts and everything was very professionally done. She bought my property subject to and handled everything.”</p>
